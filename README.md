# Static pages with markdown templates


Test project to create markdown templates (`html.md`). The static pages were created using [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage).

*  **master**: it fulfills the task using [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet). However, for some reason I couldn't use `erb` effectively in the markdown template;
*  **tilt-solution**: it fulfills the task using [Tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt), that is also used as a workaround for the `erb` problem.
